# Pop_choice

Made as part of Scrimba's javascript course, Popchoice is a browser-based movie reccomendation app that helps users discover films tailored to their preferences. The movie reccomendations are based on a list which is currently not very intensive but can be easily changed to include more movies. The app uses OpenAi's API to create a custom message below every movie and uses TMDB's API to fetch the movie poster and title. The reccomender system uses supabase and OpenAI for vector embeddings and the overall reccomendation algorithm.
